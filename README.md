# Pandas/SQL Data Cleaning Demo

This Github has the code for a [Blog demonstration](https://zach-a-greenberg.medium.com/data-cleaning-analysis-python-pandas-v-sql-8cba908a55c7) I've created featuring Data Analysis in Pandas and SQL.    

The link for the original data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/autompg-dataset?select=auto-mpg.csv). **Please note that the csv file in this repository is not the same as the original link. I have changed a few of the datatypes and deleted some values to demonstrate the data cleaning process.**    

The csv file here can be utilized to for replication purposes. The database, which is in the exact same format as the csv, is stored locally. To learn how to load it into a database, this is an excellent resource: [How to Load a Sample PostgreSQL Database in pgAdmin 4 (Pagila and Northwind)](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/autompg-dataset?select=auto-mpg.csv)
